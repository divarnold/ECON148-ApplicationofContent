Project Ideas:
- Stock Screener (core)
- How many publicly listed securities are there in the world and where? 
- Chart with Trading Signals based on Bollinger Bands.


Review of:
- Pandas
- API
- FRED API
- Surveys and RCTs -> Which market globally is performing better, industry, security within.
- Visualization
- Mapping onto visualiation library
- (SQL)?
